# Welcome to our `HackSmith21` project!

## We are Eleni Partakki and Marium Tapal, two junior undergrads with less than 24 hours to hack for this hackathon.

Our project: We decided to focus on something current, and decided to make a website that informs people in the United States about the latest updates related to the Covid19 vaccine roll-out in their state.
